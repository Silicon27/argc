# argc++

argc++ is an argument parser, but *my way*. 

I find popular argument parsers clunky, and in all honesty, I'm such an impatient individual I hate it when I have to sit and read the docs of some obtuse API written 5 years ago by some dude named "Kawasaki-chan". 

Aside from my obvious distaste for reading docs and general sarcasm, this project has been long in the planning, and I'm still unsure how I've come so long by writing for loops and if statements as a means to solve the issue of a usable CLI for my programs.

As a TUI lover, and supposedly (if you plan on using this) you are too, the handcrafted TUI of *argc++* provides customization, and that is a point I try to maintain in high regard. The mindset was to `public`ize as many members as possible, and implementing proper documentation throughout, such that any overload of provided functions integrate seamlessly as just another extension of argc++. 

### Themes
*Themes* allow developers to create custom themes that users can load in and use as part of their API.
